# WeatherMap App

WeatherMap is a modern Android application that provides real-time weather information on an interactive map. It allows users to see weather conditions for any location they select, view their current location's weather, and even see other users' locations on the map in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login using Firebase Authentication (Email & Password).
- **Interactive Map**: Utilizes the Mapbox SDK for a smooth and responsive map interface.
- **Click to See Weather**: Simply tap on any point on the map to get instant weather details for that location.
- **Current Location Weather**: A dedicated button to fetch and display weather for your current device location.
- **Real-time Location Sharing**: See where other users are on the map in real-time. Your location is also shared with others.
- **Detailed Weather Information**: Displays current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., "Clear sky"), and a descriptive icon.
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Kotlin and follows modern Android development practices using Android ViewModel for state management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Firebase**:
  - **Firebase Authentication**: For handling user sign-in and registration.
  - **Cloud Firestore**: As the backend to save and sync user locations in real-time.
- **Mapbox SDK**: For displaying the interactive map and handling map gestures.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch weather data.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Glide**: For loading and displaying weather icons.
- **Android Architecture Components**:
  - **ViewModel**: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
  - **LiveData**: To build data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes.
- **Coroutines**: For managing background threads and asynchronous operations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Android Studio installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Quiaa/WeatherMapApp.git
    ```
2.  **Setup Firebase**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Enable **Authentication** with the **Email/Password** sign-in provider.
    - Create a **Cloud Firestore** database.
    - From your project's settings, download the `google-services.json` file.
    - Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory of the project.

3.  **Setup OpenWeatherMap API Key**
    - Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create an account to get an API key.
    - In the root directory of the project, create a file named `local.properties`.
    - Add your API key to the `local.properties` file like this:
      ```properties
      OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
      ```

4.  **Setup Mapbox Access Token**
    - Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create an account to get a public access token.
    - Open the `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file.
    - Replace the placeholder `"MAPBOXAPIKEYHERE"` with your actual Mapbox access token:
      ```xml
      <string name="mapbox_access_token" translatable="false">YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN</string>
      ```

5.  **Build and Run**
    - Open the project in Android Studio.
    - Let Gradle sync the dependencies.
    - Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical device.
